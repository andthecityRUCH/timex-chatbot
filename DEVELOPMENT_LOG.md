# Timex Chatbot â€“ Development & Improvement Log

## 1. Initial Setup
- Created the base chatbot interface in `chatbot.js` (frontend) and `server.cjs` (backend).
- Used Gemini API for the backend answers for faq, and processing user input and generating neccessary output.
- Fixed version bugs with the new API key interface and Version updates required in the code. 
- Fixing npm installation to avoid future complications. 
- Implemented message bubbles for both user and bot responses.
- Added typing indicator to simulate natural response timing.

## 2. Conversation Memory
- Implemented short-term conversation memory in `server.cjs`.
- Bot now stores recent conversation history (limited session-based memory) to provide more context-aware replies.

## 3. UI Enhancements
- Styled chat bubbles for better readability and visual appeal.
- Added smooth scrolling for new messages.
- Created space for potential UI features like quick replies (but not yet implemented).

## 4. Structural Improvements
- Improved message handling between frontend (`chatbot.js`) and backend (`server.cjs`).
- Refactored code for better maintainability.
- Added error handling for API calls to prevent silent failures.

## 5. Future-Proofing
- Discussed integrating with a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to enable:
  - Long-term memory of user preferences & past conversations.
  - Storing FAQs, common queries, and structured data.
  - Analytics on user interactions for continuous improvement.
- Planned bot personalization features using stored memory.
- Discussed scalability for larger datasets and concurrent users.

âœ… **Current Focus**: The bot can remember the ongoing conversation during a session, but will lose memory after the session ends.  
ðŸš€ **Next Practical Step**: Implement database integration for persistent memory and more dynamic responses.
